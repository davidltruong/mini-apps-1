## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. $ npm run server
3. $ npm run react-dev
4. *$ npm start*
5. *Run .html*
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase some mini application problems. Depending on the app, you will either need to go through steps 1-4 for installation, or you will need to run the html file.
